## Self-hosting Guide

Before hosting, make sure your server can communicate securely with HTTPS and link to an domain name. All deploy script are based on Let's Encrypt certificates, you can customized with your own SSL certificate providers.

### Without Docker:

#### Deploy script:
 
##### 1. Get binary exectuable file

- If you want to alter the source code and build yourself, make sure you have golang environment in your server, then run script below to get and build binary file:
    ```shell=
    go get github.com/LouisYLWang/Sync-Sofa/server
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/LouisYLWang/Sync-Sofa/server
    go install
    cd $GOPATH/bin
    ```
    
- If you want to only deploy the binary file:
    1. Open [Github release page](https://github.com/LouisYLWang/Sync-Sofa/releases/latest)
    2. Download `server` binary file for linux server
    3. Download `config.json` file to the same directory of binary file
    
##### 2. In the directory of binary file, adjust config file base on your need:

- Config file variables:

    - `addr`: port of server
    - `runmode`:
        - dev: developing mode
        - prod: producting mode
    - `tlsdir`: TLS certificate paths 
      - `tlskey`: TLS certificate privatekey path 
      - `tlscert`: TLS certification path
    - `feedbackservice`: an add-on for feeedback notification
      - `smtpserverhost`: feedback mail server host
      - `smtpserverport`: feedback mail server port 
      - `feedbackemailaddr`: feedback mail sender address (without @your-mail.host)
      - `feedbackemailpswd`: feedback mail sender password 
      - `recipients`: a list of feedback receivers mail address (with @your-mail.host)

    **Notices**: `addr`, `runmode` are mandatory, `tlskey`, `tlscert` are required for TLS connection


- example config file:

```json=
{
    "addr": ":443",
    "runmode": "prod",
    "tlsdir": {
        "tlskey": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.host.url/privkey.pem",
        "tlscert": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.host.url/fullchain.pem"
    },
    "feedbackservice":{
        "smtpserverhost": "smtp.gmail.com",
        "smtpserverport": "578",
        "feedbackemailaddr": "sender_mail_name",
        "feedbackemailpswd": "password",     
        "recipients":[
            "receiver1_mail_name@mail.host",
            "receiver2_mail_name@mail.host"
        ]
    }
  }
```
3. Run `./server` to delopy the server, deployment is successful if you see:

```
found config file, read parameters from config file...
server is listening at {your_port_number}...
```
### With Docker:
Make sure docker service is runing on your server, make change to the script blow and run:

```sh
docker pull louisylwang/watchtogether

docker run -d \
-p {your docker internal port}:{your external port} \

-e ADDR=:{your port} \
-e TLSKEY={your tlskey name} \
-e TLSCERT={your tlscert name} \
-e SMTPSERVERHOST= {feedback mail server host} \
-e SMTPSERVERPORT= {feedback mail server port} \
-e FEEDBACKEMAILADDR= {feedback mail sender address} \
-e FEEDBACKEMAILPSWD= {feedback mail sender password} \
-e RUNMODE={"prod"/"dev"} \
