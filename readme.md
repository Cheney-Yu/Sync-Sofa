### Without Docker
 
 **1. Get binary executable file**

- If you want to alter the source code and build yourself, make sure you have golang environment in your server, then run script below to get and build binary file:
    ```shell=
    go get github.com/LouisYLWang/Sync-Sofa/server
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/LouisYLWang/Sync-Sofa/server
    go install
    cd $GOPATH/bin
    ```
    
- If you want to only deploy the binary file:
    1. Open [Github release page](https://github.com/LouisYLWang/Sync-Sofa/releases/latest)
    2. Download `server` binary file for linux server
    3. Download `config.json` file to the same directory of binary file
    
 **2. In the directory of binary file, adjust config file base on your need:**

- Config file variables:

    - `addr`: port of server
    - `runmode`:
        - dev: developing mode
        - prod: producting mode
    - `tlsdir`: TLS certificate paths 
      - `tlskey`: TLS certificate privatekey path 
      - `tlscert`: TLS certification path
    - `feedbackservice`: an add-on for feedback notification
      - `smtpserverhost`: feedback mail server host
      - `smtpserverport`: feedback mail server port 
      - `feedbackemailaddr`: feedback mail sender address (without @your-mail.host)
      - `feedbackemailpswd`: feedback mail sender password 
      - `recipients`: a list of feedback receivers mail address (with @your-mail.host)

    **Notices**: `addr`, `runmode` are mandatory, `tlskey`, `tlscert` are required for TLS connection


- example config file:

```json=
{
    "addr": ":443",
    "runmode": "prod",
    "tlsdir": {
        "tlskey": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.host.url/privkey.pem",
        "tlscert": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.host.url/fullchain.pem"
    },
    "feedbackservice":{
        "smtpserverhost": "smtp.gmail.com",
        "smtpserverport": "578",
        "feedbackemailaddr": "sender_mail_name",
        "feedbackemailpswd": "password",     
        "recipients":[
            "receiver1_mail_name@mail.host",
            "receiver2_mail_name@mail.host"
        ]
    }
